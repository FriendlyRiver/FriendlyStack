What ist FriendlyStack

FriendlyStack is a Network Appliance for managing physical and electronic documents as well as photos and videos. Like other appliances (think of a photocopier or a toaster) FriendlyStack is designed to fulfill its purpose as simply and efficiently as possible. FriendlyStack was designed with lazy people in mind. Managing your stuff with FriendlyStack is effortless and doesnâ€™t require a PhD in Computer Wizardry (this is why FriendlyStack's Control Unit has just one button).
